      "question": "What does the tone() function do in Arduino?",
      "options": [
        "Generates a square wave on a pin to produce sound",
        "Measures sound frequency from a microphone",
        "Stops sound output from a buzzer",
        "Plays MP3 audio files"

        "noTone()",
        "silence()"

      "options": [
        "Time in seconds since the last delay() call",
        "CPU temperature",
        "Milliseconds since the board was powered on",
        "Remaining time before shutdown"

      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "millis() returns the number of milliseconds since the Arduino started running."

    {
      "id": "l2q4",
      "question": "Why is millis() preferred over delay() in some cases?",
      "options": [
        "It makes the code run slower",
        "It allows multitasking without stopping the program",
        "It uses less memory",
        "It only works with tone()"

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Unlike delay(), millis() allows you to keep the program running while tracking time."

      "options": [
        "To increase execution speed",
        "To prevent variables from changing",
        "To tell the compiler that a variable may change unexpectedly",
        "To store data permanently"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "volatile tells the compiler not to optimize a variable because it may change unpredictably (e.g., in an interrupt)."

      "id": "l2q7",
      "question": "What happens if you forget to use volatile on a variable used inside an interrupt?",

        "The program will stop compiling",
        "The variable may not update correctly, causing bugs",
        "The system will restart automatically",
        "Nothing will change"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Without volatile, the compiler may optimize the variable and ignore changes made inside an interrupt."

      "question": "Which of the following correctly plays a sound at 500Hz for 1 second?",

      "options": [
        "Detects sound frequency",
        "Loops through multiple tones and plays them one by one",
        "Records audio",
        "Plays a single tone forever"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "playMelody() runs a for loop to iterate through an array of frequencies and plays them in sequence."

      "id": "l2q10",
      "question": "What is the role of noTone(BUZZER_PIN) inside playMelody()?",
      "options": [
        "To pause between notes",
        "To increase volume",
        "To restart the loop",
        "To reduce power consumption"

      "answerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "noTone() briefly stops sound to act as a delay between musical notes."
