    {
      "id": "l5q1",
      "question": "What is an enum used for in Arduino?",
      "options": [
        "To declare floating-point constants",
        "To define a set of named constant values",
        "To store a list of strings",
        "To create a hardware interrupt"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "enum lets you create a list of named constants like IR_MODE or MUSIC_MODE."
    },

      "id": "l5q2",
      "question": "What does the volatile keyword indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The variable value never changes",
        "The variable may change unexpectedly, such as inside an interrupt",
        "The variable stores floating point data",
        "The variable is stored in EEPROM"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "volatile prevents the compiler from optimizing out variables that change in interrupts."

        "enableInterrupt()",
        "startInterrupt()"

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "attachInterrupt() runs a function automatically when a pin changes state."

      "id": "l5q4",
      "question": "What is debouncing in Arduino?",
      "options": [
        "A method to speed up button response",
        "A technique to filter electrical noise from analog sensors",

      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Debouncing prevents detecting multiple presses from one physical button press."

      "id": "l5q6",
      "question": "Why is motor acceleration implemented gradually using a for-loop?",
      "options": [
        "To make motors reverse faster",
        "To prevent sudden jerks and reduce motor stress",
        "To reduce PWM resolution",

      "question": "Which pair of functions is used to generate and stop sound?",
      "options": [
        "soundOn() and soundOff()",
        "tone() and noTone()",
        "beep() and stopBeep()",
        "buzzerOn() and buzzerOff()"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "tone() plays a sound at a given frequency, noTone() stops it."
    },
    {
      "id": "l5q8",
      "question": "What parameter in attachInterrupt() specifies which pin to monitor?",
      "options": [
        "The digital pin number directly",
        "digitalPinToInterrupt(pin)",
        "The analog pin name",
        "The PWM channel"

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "digitalPinToInterrupt(pin) converts a pin number into its interrupt number."

      "id": "l5q9",
      "question": "What happens inside switch–case when the Forward IR code is received?",
      "options": [
        "The motors stop",
        "The moveForward() function runs",
        "The mode switches to MUSIC_MODE",
        "The IR receiver resets"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "When the Forward code is detected, switch–case calls moveForward()."
    },
    {
      "id": "l5q10",
      "question": "Why is lastInterruptTime used with DEBOUNCE_DELAY in toggleMode()?",
      "options": [
        "To time how long the motor runs",
        "To avoid reading the IR signal twice",
        "To ensure enough time passes between button presses",
        "To measure PWM frequency"
      ],
      "answerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "It checks that the time since the last interrupt exceeds the debounce delay, preventing repeated triggers."
